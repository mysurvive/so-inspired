So Inspired! is a tiny module that adds an "inspiration pool" to characters, allowing them to "bank" inspiration - akin to Bennies in SWADE or Hero Points in Pathfinder 2nd Edition. The module adds a section to the legacy DND5e character sheet, the new DND5e2 character sheet, and the Tidy5e character sheet so no matter which character sheet you prefer, you can stay inspired! Chat messages are created when a character is given or uses an inspiration point with a special reminder when the character has no more inspiration to use or gains an extra inspiration when they are maxed. Maximum inspiration can be changed in the module settings.

Each player must claim their character in the user configuration for this module to work.<br><br>
